## How It Works

1. **Determine Current Week & File Paths**
   - Automatically generates paths based on the current ISO week for ASM files.
   - Uses the current weekâ€™s Monday date to locate OH part files.

2. **Data Processing**
   - Reads Excel files using pandas.
   - Performs forward fill on key columns (MPN, CUSTOMER PART NUMBER, CUSTOMER PO, QUANTITY SHIPPED, UNIT PRICE, Buyer).
   - Copies invoice numbers down rows if CUSTOMER PO values are repeated.
   - Merges OH and ASM data on CUSTOMER PART NUMBER.
   - Filters merged data for specific PGr codes.
   - Selects desired columns for the final report.

3. **Output**
   - Saves the consolidated Excel report in the structured folder path:
     //sgsind0nsifsv01a/.../ARROW SHIP MODE/WWxx'yy/JB <file_name>.xlsx
   - Prints unique Buyer Names for quick reference.
